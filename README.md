## YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection and Deployment on Hugging Face

This repository presents a custom object detection solution using YOLOv8 and UltralyticsPlus, along with deployment on Hugging Face.

## Steps

1. Install the necessary tools using "Anaconda".
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Gather the dataset for training.
4. Annotate the collected images.
5. Set up YOLOv8 (UltralyticsPlus).
6. Train the model.
7. Evaluate and test the trained model.
8. Deploy the model on Hugging Face.

## Technologies

This project utilizes a combination of open source and proprietary tools to achieve its objectives:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control and collaboration.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Environment management.
- [Simple Image Download](https://pypi.org/project/simple-image-download/) - Image collection.
- [LabelImg](https://pypi.org/project/labelImg/) - Dataset annotation.
- [Ultralyticsplus](https://github.com/fcakyon/ultralyticsplus) - for yolov8 and easy deployment on huggingface
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - Model deployment.

## Usage

For training and evaluation details, refer to the [Training folder](https://github.com/Codewello/Yolo-v8-and-huggingface/tree/main/training).
